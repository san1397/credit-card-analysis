# Stock Price Movement Analysis
Stock Price Movement Analysis

Project Overview
The Stock Price Movement Analysis project focuses on analyzing the historical stock price data of a specific company (e.g., Tesla, Apple, or any stock of choice) to understand the trends, volatility, and performance over a given time period. The primary goal of this project is to derive actionable insights from the data, visualize the stock's price movements, and highlight key trends and patterns using Python and Power BI.

Skills Used:
Python:
 - Pandas: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.

Power BI:
 - Data visualization and dashboard creation (line charts, candlestick charts, bar charts).
 - Integration of Python-processed data into Power BI for visualization.

Data Analysis:
 - Data preprocessing and handling missing values.
 - Calculating stock performance metrics (daily returns, moving averages).
 - Time-series analysis to identify trends and fluctuations.

Outcome and Benefits:
The Stock Price Movement Analysis project provided valuable insights into the performance of the stock during the chosen time period. By analyzing historical price data and calculating key metrics such as daily returns, moving averages, and volatility, this project helps investors understand market conditions, price trends, and potential risk.

The visualization in Power BI allowed the creation of interactive dashboards that could be used for decision-making and risk management.
